\chapter{Baseline}\label{ch:baseline}

In this chapter we describe the baseline implementation.
We first describe motivations for this work (\cref{sc:baseline-motivations}),
then we present the protocol (\cref{sc:baseline-protocol}).

\section{Motivations}\label{sc:baseline-motivations}

\section{Protocol}\label{sc:baseline-protocol}

The protocol doesn't guarantee any advanced security property.
It is a simple implementation of a shared folder:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Each user has a long term public identity, a X.509 certificate.
    \item Each file is encrypted with a symmetric key, using AES-GCM.
    \item The file keys are encypted under a folder key.
    \item The file key is created upon the shared folder creation.
    \item It is consequently shared with all users that have access to the folder: when a new user is added, the user adding the new user encrypts the folder key with integrated encryption elliptic curve scheme (IESCE).
\end{itemize}
