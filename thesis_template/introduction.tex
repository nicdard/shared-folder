\chapter{Introduction}

Nowdays storing data in public cloud storage systems is a well adpoted practice,
from private users to business customers, 
including even software companies relying on major cloud providers as a storage solution.
A broad variety of data is indeed stored in major cloud providers, even highly sensitive data,
such as medical records.
In cloud environments, data is stored in various locations and normally it is replicated
around the world. Users don't have any physical access to their sensitive data.
Furthermore, cloud providers are normally multi-tenat, meaning that multiple customers
can use their computing power and storage space at the same time, sharing the physical hardware.
While internet communications and instant messaging are normally End-to-end encrypted (E2EE)
