\section{CGKA}

CGKA is a major component in the SSF scheme.
The theoretical construction uses 2 CGKA groups to handle respectively:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Admins: the group of users that have access to all secrets in the key schedule, and can thus cryptographically limit access to new uploaded content to existing users.
    \item Members: the group of users that have only access to secrets that are shared by the admins.
\end{itemize}

The details of the scheme will be given in the following sections.
