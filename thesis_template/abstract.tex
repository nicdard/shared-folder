\begin{abstract}
In this thesis we explore the applications of advanced security primitives
for data at rest in real-world applications: we choose
file sharing on public cloud as our target.
We design and implement
a Secure Shared Folder (SSF) scheme, on top of the primitives from~\cite{GKP}.
With this implementation,
we uncover issues in the cryptographic constructions, in academic
modelling and assumptions,
in the cryptographic ecosystem of the browsers
and in cryptographic libraries. 
Together, all the issues result in gaps
that need to be addressed by implementors 
to make the system production-ready.
The implementation uncovered errors in the pseudocode
of the primitives from~\cite{GKP}, which we fixed.
To solve the errors, we 
contribute to the primitives with enhancements to
better model and fit the reality of their applications. 
With this work, we provide also a survey of the state-of-the-art
of the technology we considered during the implementation,
to serve as a guide for future researchers and developers 
which dare to take the same path.
Together with this thesis, we give public access to the repository
made up of more than 50000 lines between code, tests and documentation.
