\begin{abstract}
In this thesis, we explore advanced security primitives
for data at rest in real-world applications: we choose
file sharing on public cloud as our target.
We design and implement
a Secure Shared Folder (SSF) scheme, on top of the primitives from~\cite{GKP}.
With this implementation,
we uncover issues in the cryptographic constructions, in academic
modelling and assumptions,
in the cryptographic ecosystem of the browsers
and in cryptographic libraries. 
Together, all the issues result in gaps
that need to be addressed by implementors 
to make the system production-ready.
The implementation uncovered errors in the pseudocode
of the primitives from~\cite{GKP}, which we fixed.
To solve the errors, we 
contribute to the primitives with enhancements to
better model and fit the reality of their applications. 
With this work, we also provide a survey of the state-of-the-art
of the technology we considered during the implementation,
to serve as a guide for future researchers and developers 
which dare to take the same path.
Our implementation is publicly available on GitHub
as a reference.
We seek to shed light on the many problems developers face 
in implementing cryptography
in real applications. These problems
should be addressed by the cryptographic community
together with other organizations that maintain the standards
of the most widely used technologies to date
to make it easy to develop more secure applications.
