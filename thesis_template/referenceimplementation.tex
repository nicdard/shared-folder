\chapter{Reference Implementation}\label{ch:reference-implementation}

\section{Overview}

In this chapter we will present the design and implementation of the reference implementation, 
so called ``Baseline'' borrowing from Benchmarking terminology, 
which is a simpler version of the system offering lower guarantees in terms of security,
using a na\"ive cryptographic construction to manage the folder state.
This implementation is first addressed as it is much simpler in terms of cryptography,
but still requires all the supporting infrastructure that will be reused also for the SSF scheme development.
