\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank supervisors Matilda Backendal and Matteo Scarlata,
for their guidance and support throughout the project.
Before the project started, I did have little experience with
cryptography. With this project I had the opportunity to
learn and explore the field in depth. 
I was not convinced I would have been able to provide
a consistent contribution, but in retrospective I am really
proud of the work we have done together.
I think it was an ambitious and exciting experiment,
working in a cross-functional team, trying to bridge
research and industry backgrounds, 
has been a fascinating experience.
This work really renovated my interest in the field of cryptography
and its applications.
To them, I want also to express a more personal gratitude,
for also understanding my personal difficulties and
helping me to succeed in this project despite all the obstacles.

I want also to acknowledge David B{\'a}lbas and Miro Haller for 
being always available for questions and clarifications on the primitives,
and to hear my opinions and suggestions always providing
constructive feedback and valuable insights. It was a pleasure
to work with them.

I would like to thank Professor Dr. Kenny Paterson
for hosting this project in his group, for the suggestions
on how to structure the final thesis and the interest
demonstrated in the project even though the direction
of this work was different from the usual format of the thesis
of his group.

Finally, I would like to thank my family and friends, for always
being on my side, especially during the difficult and stressful
times. My parents have always been supportive of my choices and
following my achievements and giving me suggestions, 
even with the physical distance, 
always encouraging me without pushing in any direction. 
My friends have been
a really precious resource, without them, I could not have
made it to this point, in many situations. Among them, I want
especially to mention Andrea Basile.
%I would like also to thank my ex-girlfriend, Ludovica, 
%who encouraged me to come to ETH in Zurich and in many
%other situations in my career path, despite the
%distance that would have brought between us.
