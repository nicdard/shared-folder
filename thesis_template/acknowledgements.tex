\begin{abstract}
First and foremost, I need to thank my supervisors Matilda Backendal and Matteo Scarlata,
for their guidance and support throughout the project.
Before the project started, I did have little experience with
cryptography. With this work, I had the opportunity to
learn and explore the field in depth. 
I was not convinced I would have been able to provide
a consistent contribution. 
Thank you for convincing me of the importance of this project
and believing in me.
In retrospect, I am really
proud of the work we have done together.
I think it was an ambitious and fascinating experiment:
working in a cross-functional team, trying to bridge
research and industry backgrounds.
This work renewed my interest in the field of 
cryptography and its applications, and it's all thanks
to the many hours spent together.
To them, I want also to express more personal gratitude,
for also understanding my personal difficulties and
helping me to succeed in this project despite all the obstacles.
I look forward to sharing much more time together and continue
discussing with you many exciting topics.
My schedule has always been a mess,
so, again, thanks for adapting to it and giving me feedback literally
at any time, you have been amazing.

I also want to acknowledge David B{\'a}lbas and Miro Haller for 
being always available for questions and clarifications on the primitives,
and to hear my opinions and suggestions, always providing
constructive feedback and valuable insights. It was a pleasure
to work with them.

I would like to thank Professor Dr. Kenny Paterson
for hosting this project in his group, for the suggestions
on how to structure the final thesis and the interest
demonstrated in the project even if the direction
of this work was different from the usual research of his group.

Finally, I want to thank those who helped me throughout my journey.
To my parents and bigger brothers: you are always supportive of my choices,
following my achievements, listening to me complaining about my problems
and giving me suggestions, 
and always encouraging me without pushing too much in any direction. I do love you.
\newline
To Nuccio D'Angelo: your teachings will stay with me for all my life,
and guide me in becoming a better version of myself. 
You have been much more than a teacher to me. 
\newline
To my friends: you have been a precious resource, without you, 
I could not have made it to this point, in many situations.
You fill my heart with joy and I know I can just be
myself with you: you will understand my jokes and laugh with me.
I want especially to thank you, Baso. Thanks for being such a 
real and trustworthy friend, you are a rare type.
