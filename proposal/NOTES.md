# Current proposal:

Main work (graded):
* WP1: background
* WP2: pick one setting for the theoretical protocol (i.e., fix the threat model and hence the protocol to be implemented). This includes gathering relevant input from industry, but only on the level of choosing between the threat models that we have for this protocol or slightly adapting them. That is, the goal here is not to redesign the system entirely based on the real-world requirements. (But you can save everything you learn here for WP7)
* WP3: implement the baseline
* WP4-5: (might just be one if we can use CGKA out of the box): implement CGKA and the theoretical protocol
* WP6: benchmark

Extensions:
* WP7: specify the real-world functionality and security requirements of users. For example, pick the industry setting and see what a useful file sharing system there would provide. (This would be super-interesting for us to know, even if it doesn't result in an implementation!)
* WP8: adjust the threat model and if needed also the design of the protocol to suit the requirements.
* WP9: implement the new design
* WP10: benchmark and compare the three implementations
